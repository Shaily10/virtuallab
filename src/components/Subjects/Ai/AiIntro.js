        <p>The AI LAB is designed to enable students to rotate between the AI Stations, exposing them to multiple disciplines and various scenarios where artificial intelligence takes control of our lives.</p>
        <p>It converts generic STEM concepts to real-life experiences, which put artificial intelligence in the center of learning. Developed by the students, the Al is used to control smart cars and drones, automate production lines, design human-robot interactions, and even take them to space exploration where robots must make decisions autonomously, without a hot-link to a human operator many millions of miles away.</p>
